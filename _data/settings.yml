  author_section_title: "Hi there üëã ! Welcome to Jishnu's Systems Immunology Lab. We're a vibrant community passionate about both science and coffee."
  author_section_description: "As a computational systems immunology lab, our research focuses on the development and use of novel systems approaches to analyze high-dimensional immunological datasets, and elucidate molecular mechanisms of immunological disorders. We are currently working on using network systems and functional genomic approaches to perform multi-scale integration of genomic and epigenomic datasets with biological networks to identify molecular phenotypes underlying these immunological disorders. We also use statistical and machine-learning techniques to integrate multi-omic datasets (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and antibody-omic) and elucidate molecular mechanisms of immune regulation and dysregulation."
